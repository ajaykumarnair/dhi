Dhi (or Dhi:) has many meanings related to consciousness and wellbeing. 
It is related to buddhi (a discriminating intellect), dhyana (deep contemplation), and samadhi (mental absorption). 
In essence, Dhi reflects deep, reflective intelligence: the faculty of thoughtful, meditative insight and wise discernment.

Dhi research aims to leverage insights from modern neuroscience and ancient philosophy to consider ways of facilitating wellbeing in all stages of life, for the individual and for society at large.
